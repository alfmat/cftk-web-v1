        <p class="card-text">
          The FTK Fund is the flagship grant of the Carolina For The Kids Foundation, which provides families with financial assistance for needs that are not covered by their medical insurance. We partner with a dedicated team of nurses, social workers, care management, and administrative staff at UNC Children’s to distribute this fund to families who need it. Assistance is provided for meal tickets, gas cards, and critical bill payments. The For the Kids Fund is CFTK’s most integral grant because it directly supports our mission of providing for the emotional and financial needs of the patients and families of UNC Children’s. When a child is hospitalized, we believe parents should focus on getting their child well, rather than worrying about getting to and from the hospital or how their bills at home are being paid in their absence. Since providing for these emotional and financial needs is of the utmost importance to CFTK, a “For the Kids” story is read at the conclusion of every CFTK meeting. FTK stories remind committee members and volunteers of the important work they are doing and the difference they are making in the lives of the patients and families of UNC Children’s.

        <h4 class="card-title">Parents' Night Out</h4>
        <p class="card-text">
          Carolina FTK partners with Coastal Federal Credit Union to host Parent’s Night Out, a weekly dinner served to the parents of children who are staying on inpatient floors of the N.C. Children’s Hospital. Meals are served by CFTK student volunteers. Parents’ Night Out, commonly referred to as PNO, is CFTK’s second-most longstanding grant, next to the For the Kids Fund. Just last year alone, CFTK served 18,720 meals. PNO is special to CFTK because not only does it allow committee members to directly interact with the patients and families served by UNC Children’s, it creates one less worry for parents and families. While parents are busy caring for their children, the last thing they should have to worry about is where their next meal is coming from. PNO strives to create a sense of community, while alleviating one of the many worries on families’ minds while their children are hospitalized.

          Through the assistance of Carolina FTK, the Pediatric Play Atrium on the 7th floor of N.C. Children’s Hospital is able to stay open for extended hours so that children can leave their hospital rooms and play. The Pediatric Play Atrium is an accessible playspace for kids to enjoy and forget that they are hospitalized. CFTK student volunteers visit the Play Atrium and bring crafts to interact with patients.

        <p class="card-text">
          ​CFTK has had the special opportunity to help fund critical research and non-research projects to improve the healthcare outcomes of children impacted by UNC Children’s. These grants have allowed faculty at UNC Children’s to supplement care, bring play and joy to child patients, and test new treatment methods for children at UNC to help them heal faster.

        <p class="card-text">
          In previous years, the Carolina For The Kids Foundation has funded 10 new parent sleeper couches for inpatient rooms on two floors of N.C. Children’s Hospital. These beds allow parents to sleep comfortably in their child’s room so that they do not have to leave their child’s bedside.
