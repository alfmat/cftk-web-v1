      <strong>Favorite CFTK moment:</strong>
      My favorite CFTK moment is when we revealed the total funds raised at the
      2019 Dance Marathon! I have never felt such a rush of emotions before in
      my life. To see all of my fellow Board member's smiles and happy tears,
      along with our Dancers' cheers, after we showed the numbers on stage was
      truly an unforgettable experience and I cannot wait for the 2020 Total Reveal!

      <strong>What CFTK means to me:</strong> Carolina For The Kids has grown
      to mean so much to me throughout my past 3 years at Carolina. It means
      not only providing leadership and community service work to fellow
      students, but more importantly, working together to help improve the
      lives of some absolutely amazing kids. CFTK means gaining friends who
      have become like a second family to me, which I will forever be grateful
      for. CFTK means standing for 24 hours to show families and patients that
      there is a whole university supporting them and striving to make their
      lives any bit happier and easier.

      <strong>Favorite CFTK moment:</strong>
      At the end of the 2019 Marathon, I was standing near the stage for family hour. When I heard the families share their stories and saw the kids having fun dancing and playing games, I couldn't hold back my tears. Afterwards, we all danced to "We're All in This Together" and had sway time, and it was amazing to see right in front of me what it meant to be a part of something bigger than myself. I cried even more during the total reveal! I was so happy and proud of what we did to make a difference in the patients' and families' lives that I didn't sit down because I completely forgot that I was tired and my feet hurt!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What CFTK means to me:</strong>
      For me, doing all things For The Kids is one of my greatest passions in life. I have been a part of the dance marathon movement since I was in 8th grade, when I first got involved with my high school's dance marathon program. During that time, I spent multiple years on the program's Executive Board and was also diagnosed with multiple chronic illnesses. As a result, I was a frequent patient of the children's hospital that our dance marathon was raising money for and saw first hand the immense impact that our work was having on the patients and families. I know that all day, every day there are kids and their families at UNC Children's, right here on campus, and being a part CFTK means that I can stand in solidarity with them and make a positive, lasting difference in their lives.

      <strong>Favorite CFTK moment:</strong>
      Playing UNO with one of our KCC's and other CFTK committee members in the Pediatric Playroom. I was about to win with a "+4" card but I forgot that they reversed the order, so when I put it down they told me and I felt completely defeated. The KCC crushed us all in UNO. I am still waiting for round 2.

      <strong>What CFTK means to me:</strong>
      Being apart of this organization I realize the impact that we have on families, and knowing how hard my family struggled when I was in the hospital, I wish that they had an organization like this to turn to. So because my parents did not have an opportunity like this, I want to make sure that every family from here on out has this opportunity. CFTK means giving hope and security back to the families so they can focus on their child's well being. Every smile that we can put on a patient or a family members face means the world to me, and I want to do my best to continuing spreading smiles.

      <strong>Favorite CFTK moment:</strong>
      My favorite CFTK moment is the final 15 minutes of the marathon and the 10 minutes following the end. During those final 15 minutes we normally do the final jam and the total reveal and I feel like during that time the energy is the most electric. Even though everyone is extremely tired, they become super pumped to celebrate all of the hard work we did that year for the kids. It’s almost as if a sudden pulse goes through everyone and they have so much more energy than they had for the previous 12 hours. In the minutes following the marathon, after everyone has sat down and started standing back up, people still continue to linger, talk, and share in the memories of the past year. Even though they are tired, and their feet hurt, they stay and continue to share in the bonds and memories that CFTK has so graciously gifted them with. I just think it is the most incredible thing to see. It reminds me that the bonds made in CFTK are bonds that are so incredibly special and are bonds that can last for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What CFTK means to me:</strong>
      To me CFTK means working to give every kid an opportunity to be a kid and every parent the opportunity to be a parent again. The emotional and financial stress of having a sick child, I can imagine, is overwhelming and draining. But outside of that it can also be isolating, these families continuously fight and struggle for their kids, siblings, and overall family unit despite all of the hardship. We show them that we see them, we care, and we are going to help shoulder some of that weight and we don’t leave them alone in what is probably the hardest time of their lives. We give some joy and hope to these families, and we give them opportunities to enjoy and live in the moments they can share as a family. It is absolutely incredible to me how much this organization has grown, and how much it continues to do so. I have met some of the most incredible people through this organization, and I am constantly reminded of the power that a student can have, and the possibilities that can be realized when people work together out of love and out of a shared desire to produce happiness. I am extremely grateful just to be able to witness a small piece of this experience and see what it truly means to do something For the Kids.

The fact that college students put aside the work in their lives to help make one of the most stressful times in these families' lives a bit less stressful never ceases to amaze me.

      Being able to bring a smile to the face of the kids at UNC Children’s through our pediatric playroom, parents night out, and various hospital events are my favorite parts of CFTK.

Bringing community, love, and hope to these families is such an incredible honor, and I consider myself lucky to be a part of such a life-changing organization.
